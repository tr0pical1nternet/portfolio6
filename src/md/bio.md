I am a front-end developer with 6 years of experience designing and developing websites for small businesses. I employ modern standards of symantics and accessibility to produce sites which are easy to navigate for a wide range of users and optimized for both search engines and headless browsers. I bring a strong knowledge of both graphic design and user experience to every project. 

In 2012 I founded [Sediment Press](https://sedimentpress.com) as graphic and web design company. We attracted national clients, received grants, were written about in printing publications and invited to speaking events. Among our most notable clients were Turnaround Arts, an education initiative directed by Michelle Obama, The American Society of Civil Engineers, Live Nation, World Food Program USA, and the Del Ray Business Association.

I am currently seeking projects or full-time positions developing sites using static site generators, JAM Stacks, Gatsby, WordPress REST API, or building web applications using Vue, React, Svelte, Elm, or D3.
