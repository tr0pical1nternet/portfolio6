I am a Front End Developer with 6 years of experience building websites for individuals and small businesses. I have a talent for designing sites that are accessible, performant, with user friendly interfaces. I make static sites in Node.js, e-commerce sites in WordPress, and am have experience building sites in SquareSpace, Wix, and Shopify platforms.

In 2012 I founded Sediment Press with one business partner. In addition to web design we do graphic design and illustration, from logos to packaging. We have attracted national clients, received grants, been written about in printing publications and invited to speaking events. Among our most notable clients were Turnaround Arts, an education initiative spearheaded by Michelle Obama, The American Society of Civil Engineers, Live Nation, World Food Program USA, and the Del Ray Business Association.

I want to make the web easier, faster, and prettier.
