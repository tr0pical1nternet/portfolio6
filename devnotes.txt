Fix gallery vertical scrolling issue in firefox
Replace scroll bars?! They are super clunky! Probably terrible UX to fuck with!!!
Customize CSS ease for slide animation
-- Clean up markup for slides, remove extra divs. Replace list with div
-- Restructure gallery so every device is in its own slide.
Content
	Bio
		Write Bio paragraphs
		New pic not in a tank top
	Portfolio
		Make screen shots for other sites. Sediment Press, Spruced, CDesigns
Add underline to portfolio on open

Accessibility
	Get working keyboard and screen reader versions BEFORE the javascript version

Progressive Enhancement
	Site loads symantically, and then javascript disects it and reassembles into sliders

Can you have more than one slider controlled by slick?
