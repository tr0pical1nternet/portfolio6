Fix gallery vertical scrolling issue in firefox
Replace scroll bars?! They are super clunky! Probably terrible UX to fuck with!!!
Try to replace touch scroll with a slider or use another scroll library

-- Restructure gallery so every device is in its own slide.

Content
	Bio
		Write Bio paragraphs
	Portfolio
		Augment portfolio entries, use blink(?) as reference

	Tablet
		Devices are grouped in slides

Accessibility
	Screen reader versions BEFORE the javascript version
